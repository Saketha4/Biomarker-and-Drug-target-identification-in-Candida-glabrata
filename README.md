# Biomarker discovery and Drug target identification in Candida glabrata

Candida glabrata is an opportunistic yeast that poses a growing threat in immunocompromised patients, particularly due to its increasing resistance to common antifungal agents. Identifying unique biomarkers and effective drug targets is critical for developing new therapeutic strategies.

This project outlines a comprehensive methodology for discovering biomarkers and identifying drug targets in Candida glabrata, a significant fungal pathogen known for its resistance to antifungal therapies. The integration of computational tools such as genome-scale metabolic models, BLASTp, molecular docking, AlphaFold, DALI, and inhibitor design will be detailed.
