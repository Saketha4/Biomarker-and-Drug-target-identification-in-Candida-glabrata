# Biomarker discovery and Drug target identification in Candida glabrata
This project outlines a comprehensive methodology for discovering biomarkers and identifying drug targets in Candida glabrata, a significant fungal pathogen known for its resistance to antifungal therapies. The integration of computational tools such as genome-scale metabolic models, BLASTp, molecular docking, AlphaFold, DALI, and inhibitor design will be detailed.
